After completing a task in this project, follow these steps:

1. **Build**: Run `npm run build` to ensure the code compiles correctly.
2. **Diagnostics**: Use `lsp_diagnostics` to check for any TypeScript errors or warnings in the modified files.
3. **Verification**: If possible, verify the changes by running the plugin within an OpenCode environment.
4. **Cleanup**: Ensure no temporary files or debug logs are left in the codebase.
